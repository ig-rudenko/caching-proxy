## ‚≠ê Key Features:

- **No external dependencies!**
- Caches data to disk, allowing you to specify a custom cache directory, reducing memory usage.
- Can cache responses uniquely for each user based on their cookies and user agent.
- Manual cache clearing available.
- Adds `X-Cache: HIT` or `X-Cache: MISS` headers to responses, indicating whether the response is served from the cache or fetched from the server.
- Automatically purges outdated cache entries with customizable expiration times.
- Only caches safe HTTP methods (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`), ensuring the normal operation of your site is not disrupted.

## ü§î Usage

For example, to run the proxy on port 3000 and forward requests to https://github.com/, use the following command:

```shell
caching-proxy --port 3000 --origin https://github.com/
```
